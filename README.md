  ### Installation
  First, install the node package manager using sudo apt install nodejs. Then install the package inquirer using npm install inquirer. That's all the user will need for this application.

  ### Testing
  To test the app, go to the appropriate directory that hosts the index.js file. Simply run node index.js to begin the prompts. The README.md file will be automatically generated in the home directory. It can be viewed using the md preview. 

  ### Description
  This project is an exploration into automatically generating a README.md file. It will prompt the user with a series of questions that allow them to describe their project and other details required in a quality readme, including contributors, languages, and contact information.
